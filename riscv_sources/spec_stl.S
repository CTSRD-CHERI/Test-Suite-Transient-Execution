Spectre-STL

The store and the load go to the same address, but memory
disambiguation resolves them speculatively as non-dependent.
Therefore the load is issued before the store returns stale
data.

load to: 0x0000000080010400

HPM measurements

Loads microachitecturally : 5
Loads architecturally:      3
